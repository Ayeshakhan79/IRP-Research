# IRP-Research

**Project Overview:**

The IRP collects maternal health data including antenatal (ANC), postnatal (PNC), ultrasound, and obstetric records to support research, program monitoring, and data-driven decision-making

**My Contribution:**

1. Data Cleaning & Quality Checks (QC):
Developed Python scripts to standardize and clean datasets, handle missing values, and validate entries.
Implemented automated QC checks to detect inconsistencies and data anomalies.

2. Data Dictionary & Documentation:
Created a detailed data dictionary defining each variable, its type, and possible values for ANC, PNC, ultrasound, and obstetric datasets.

3. SQL Queries for Data Validation:
Used SQL to perform data validation, extract subsets for analysis, and ensure referential integrity across tables.

4.Automated Analytics in Python:
Performed summary statistics, distributions, and trends on cleaned data using Python libraries.

**Key Benefits:**

Ensured high-quality, consistent, and reliable datasets for research use.
Reduced manual errors through automated QC and analytics scripts.
Prepared data for downstream analysis and reporting while maintaining confidentiality.
